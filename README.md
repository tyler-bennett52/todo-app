#### Attribution

Built from starter code. Unit tests are mostly my own, but relied heavily on ChatGPT for app.test.jsx, specifically the renderWithContext function which is used in every test. Context test followed the format we used in class. List.test.js is my own logic, but chatGPT recommended the loop to test mulitple list items.
